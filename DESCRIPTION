Description:
    Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a statistical method to fit a
    Bayesian model to data when the likelihood function is hard to compute.
    The approxbayescomp package implements an efficient form of ABC - the
    sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm. While it can handle any general
    statistical problem, we built in some models so that fitting insurance
    loss distributions is particularly easy.
