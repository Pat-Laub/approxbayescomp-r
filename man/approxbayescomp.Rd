\description{
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a statistical method to fit a
Bayesian model to data when the likelihood function is hard to compute.
The `approxbayescomp` package implements an efficient form of ABC â€” the
sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm. While it can handle any general
statistical problem, we built in some models so that fitting insurance
loss distributions is particularly easy.
